-No changes to Siege Creep yet


[u]TO DO: Thoughts & Fixes [Help wanted here! Please share your ideas][/u]
-Goal of the game? How do you win?
-Positioning and Relevance of:
	-Shrines, Shops (Normal, Secret, Side)
	-Other Towers
	-Roshan
	-Neutrals
-Fixing the Texture blending on the bridge
-Removing that fucking stone I forgot near Radiant Top T1'
-Possibly changing the tree-block-pathing thing at the bottom river trees
-Moving left Radiant T1 slightly more to the bottom-right (for the cliff ward; or vice versa on the right Dire T1 as it doesn't grant True Sight over the entire cliff - yet, the center)
